    <link>https://tck.mn/blog/botc-demons</link>
    <description>What if you took the popular social deduction game Blood on the Clocktower,

    <title>An unnecessarily deep dive into the board game Gizmos</title>
    <link>https://tck.mn/blog/gizmos-boardgame</link>
    <description>Gizmos
is a nifty engine building game
themed around collecting a bunch of little gadgets that work together.
I would guess about 0.2% of the people reading this
wonder about questions like
&amp;quot;what's the maximum theoretically possible score?&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;what's the fastest theoretically possible game?&amp;quot;
To those 0.2% of people...
I'm so glad you asked!</description>

Wait, it feels like I've written this intro before...</description>

near-universal in modern programming languages,

how hard could it be?</description>
