<p>You are peacefully going about your day
when you are suddenly thrust into the following position
in a game of Slay the Spire.
What do you do?</p>


<p>(This puzzle is probably not particularly accessible
to readers who haven't played Slay the Spire,
but if you want to try it anyway,
<a href="mechanics">here's an excessively detailed explanation of all the mechanics at play</a>.)</p>

<h2>how did we get here?</h2>
<p>On my path to unlocking all the Watcher ascensions,
I found myself on floor 48
(the floor before the final act 3 campfire)
with a deck that absolutely would not beat Awakened One.
It had literally no scaling,
and my plan for pretty much all of act 3
was &quot;I have two <span class='sts stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw cards until your hand is full. Exhaust./1 (0)'>Scrawl</span>s and if I find <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgp' data-desc='Whenever you enter Wrath, draw 2 cards./1 (0)'>Rushdown</span> I go infinite&quot;.
I don't have screenshots from before the boss fight,
but the deck was:</p>
<p><img class='card' src='/img/sts/Scrawl+.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/Scrawl+.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/EmptyMind+.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/InnerPeace.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/CutThroughFate.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/EmptyFist+.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/DefendP.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/Eruption+.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/StrikeP.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/StrikeP.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/StrikeP.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/Vigilance+.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/Violence.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/AscendersBane.png'></p>
<p>Floor 48 was a shop,
which I had pathed to in order to find literally anything to save me --
maybe a potion,
but realistically probably an infinite enabler.
(Which in practice means,
yes,
I was basically just thinking &quot;hello please give me <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgp' data-desc='Whenever you enter Wrath, draw 2 cards./1 (0)'>Rushdown</span>&quot;.)</p>
<p>I opened the shop,
and I did not find a <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgp' data-desc='Whenever you enter Wrath, draw 2 cards./1 (0)'>Rushdown</span>.
Instead,
I stared at the shop,
thought for a long time,
and decided there was exactly one thing I could do in that shop
to maximize my chances of survival:
remove a <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 6 (9) damage./1'>Strike</span>,
buy a <span class='sts stspotion' data-desc='Upgrade all cards in your hand for the rest of combat.'>Blessing of the Forge</span>,
and buy both colorless cards on offer:</p>
<p><img class='card' src='/img/sts/Purity.png'><img class='card' src='/img/sts/Chrysalis.png'></p>
<p>Certainly unconventional,
but the justification was that my only hope was pulling an infinite out of the <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle 3 (5) random Skills into your draw pile. They cost 0 this combat. Exhaust./2'>Chrysalis</span>.
And as you might guess,
that's what the puzzle is about.</p>
<p>(I am about to reveal the answer,
so now is your last chance to stop reading if you want to try finding it!)</p>
<h2>the provable infinite</h2>
<p>It is possible to guarantee infinite damage/energy/block
on both phases of Awakened One,
and therefore provably win the game,
from the pictured state.
As a reminder if you don't want to scroll up,
the hand is</p>
<ul>
<li><span class='sts stsu stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw cards until your hand is full. Exhaust./1 (0)'>Scrawl+</span> <span class='desc'>(0 cost draw to full hand)</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsu stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw 2 (3) cards. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Mind+</span> <span class='desc'>(1 cost draw 3, exit stance)</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Calm, draw 3 (4) cards, otherwise enter Calm./1'>Inner Peace</span> <span class='desc'>(1 cost draw 3 if in calm, enter calm otherwise)</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 6 (9) damage./1'>Strike</span></li>
</ul>
<p>and the draw pile is</p>
<ul>
<li><span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 5 (8) Block./1'>Defend</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsu stsrb stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 9 damage. Enter Wrath./2 (1)'>Eruption+</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 6 (9) damage./1'>Strike</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsu stsrb stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 8 (12) Block. Enter Calm./2'>Vigilance+</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span> <span class='desc'>(1 cost 7 damage, scry 2, draw 1)</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsu stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 9 (14) damage. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Fist+</span> <span class='desc'>(1 cost 14 damage, exit stance)</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Apply 8 (11) Mark. ALL enemies lose HP equal to their Mark./1'>Pressure Points</span> at 0 cost <span class='desc'>(8 mark, all enemies lose mark hp)</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Put a Miracle+ into your hand at the start of your next X(+1) turns. Exhaust./X'>Collect</span> <span class='desc'>(X cost get a <span class='sts stsu stsrs stscc stsgs' data-desc='Retain. Gain [W] ([W]). Exhaust./0'>Miracle+</span> the next X turns)</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsru stscc stsgs' data-desc='Exhaust up to 3 (5) cards in your hand. Exhaust./0'>Purity</span> <span class='desc'>(0 cost exhaust 3)</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='(Retain.) Gain 5 Mantra./2'>Worship</span> at 0 cost <span class='desc'>(5 mantra)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The infinite, assuming all cards in hand, goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span> drawing <span class='sts stsu stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw 2 (3) cards. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Mind+</span></li>
<li><span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='(Retain.) Gain 5 Mantra./2'>Worship</span> for +5 mantra</li>
<li><span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Calm, draw 3 (4) cards, otherwise enter Calm./1'>Inner Peace</span> to enter calm</li>
<li><span class='sts stsu stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw 2 (3) cards. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Mind+</span> for +2 energy drawing <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span>, <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='(Retain.) Gain 5 Mantra./2'>Worship</span>, <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Calm, draw 3 (4) cards, otherwise enter Calm./1'>Inner Peace</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Since <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='(Retain.) Gain 5 Mantra./2'>Worship</span> is free from <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle 3 (5) random Skills into your draw pile. They cost 0 this combat. Exhaust./2'>Chrysalis</span>,
each cycle costs 3 energy.
But you get 2 back from leaving calm,
so each cycle costs net 1 energy.
And every other cycle you enter divinity and gain 3 energy,
for an overall gain of 1 energy every two cycles.
In the meantime, <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span> has been doing infinite damage
(and you can replace <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='(Retain.) Gain 5 Mantra./2'>Worship</span> with <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Apply 8 (11) Mark. ALL enemies lose HP equal to their Mark./1'>Pressure Points</span> after accumulating enough energy
to speed things up greatly).</p>
<p>How do you guarantee it?
Exhausting down to 6 cards is definitely enough,
since if your initial draw has <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span> you just start the cycle,
and if not you play <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw 2 (3) cards. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Mind</span> first.
This amounts to playing <span class='sts stsu stsru stscc stsgs' data-desc='Exhaust up to 3 (5) cards in your hand. Exhaust./0'>Purity+</span> for 5,
and also playing <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Put a Miracle+ into your hand at the start of your next X(+1) turns. Exhaust./X'>Collect</span> for anything.
<span class='sts stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw cards until your hand is full. Exhaust./1 (0)'>Scrawl</span> draws all but 3,
and then <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Calm, draw 3 (4) cards, otherwise enter Calm./1'>Inner Peace</span> followed by <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw 2 (3) cards. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Mind</span> just leaves 1.
If it's <span class='sts stsru stscc stsgs' data-desc='Exhaust up to 3 (5) cards in your hand. Exhaust./0'>Purity</span> or <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Put a Miracle+ into your hand at the start of your next X(+1) turns. Exhaust./X'>Collect</span>,
you have <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span>,
so play it.
Finally,
drink the <span class='sts stspotion' data-desc='Upgrade all cards in your hand for the rest of combat.'>Blessing of the Forge</span>,
play <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Put a Miracle+ into your hand at the start of your next X(+1) turns. Exhaust./X'>Collect</span>,
and play <span class='sts stsru stscc stsgs' data-desc='Exhaust up to 3 (5) cards in your hand. Exhaust./0'>Purity</span> on 5 garbage cards
(there are only 4 cards in the infinite,
2 of which are in discard,
and there are 8 other cards in your hand,
so at least 8 - 2 = 6 of them are garbage).</p>
<p>Of course,
you might not have to do any of this --
I <span class='sts stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw cards until your hand is full. Exhaust./1 (0)'>Scrawl</span>ed into <span class='sts stsru stscc stsgs' data-desc='Exhaust up to 3 (5) cards in your hand. Exhaust./0'>Purity</span> <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Put a Miracle+ into your hand at the start of your next X(+1) turns. Exhaust./X'>Collect</span> and was able to immediately start the infinite.
It's probably possible to guarantee actually executing the infinite this turn,
especially with <span class='sts stspotion' data-desc='This turn, your next 1 (2) cards are played twice.'>Duplication Potion</span> and <span class='sts stspotion' data-desc='Play the top 3 (6) cards of your draw pile.'>Distilled Chaos</span>,
but I didn't bother figuring it out since you can tank the current hit anyway.</p>
<p>Cool! So that's it for this post, right?</p>
<h2>that's it for this post, right?</h2>
<p>... well.</p>
<p>That was a pretty lucky <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle 3 (5) random Skills into your draw pile. They cost 0 this combat. Exhaust./2'>Chrysalis</span>.
The entire strategy hinged on the free <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='(Retain.) Gain 5 Mantra./2'>Worship</span> that it generated.
So just how lucky did I have to get to win this game?</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity,
let's say I win if I go infinite
and I lose if I don't.
This isn't really true,
because I'm sure there are plenty of ways 3 free skills can be good enough without being infinite,
but it's obviously impractical to analyze them all,
so this will at least give a lower bound.</p>
<p>It's still impractical to compute the probability of an infinite, right?
Well let's do it anyway.
Here's a categorization of all the Watcher skills
based on what they would do for my deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Whiffs</strong>:
These will never do anything to directly create an infinite,
so they are essentially curses.
(But they still might be useful for energy and damage neutral infinites
that need some other card to play for its effect.)</p>
<p><span class='sts stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='(Innate.) Shuffle a Beta into your draw pile. Exhaust./1'>Alpha</span>
<span class='sts stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle an Expunger (with X+1) into your draw pile. Exhaust./X'>Conjure Blade</span>
<span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 4 (7) Block. Add a Safety into your hand./1'>Deceive Reality</span>
<span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 7 (10) Block. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Body</span>
<span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 3 (4) Block. If you are in Wrath, gain 9 (14) additional Block./0'>Halt</span>
<span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Wrath, apply 3 (5) Vulnerable to ALL enemies, otherwise enter Wrath./1'>Indignation</span>
<span class='sts stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='If the enemy has 30 (40) or less HP, set their HP to 0./1'>Judgment</span>

<span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Whenever you gain Block this turn, apply 1 (2) Weak to ALL enemies./1'>Wave of the Hand</span>
<span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Your next Attack deals 5 (8) additional damage./1'>Wreath of Flame</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exhaust/Retain</strong>:
These cards will get out of the way of an infinite
by not eating up draws,
but they won't produce an infinite themselves.</p>
<p><span class='sts stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='(Retain.) Enter Divinity. Die next turn. Exhaust./1'>Blasphemy</span>
<span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Put a Miracle+ into your hand at the start of your next X(+1) turns. Exhaust./X'>Collect</span>
<span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Retain. Enter Wrath. Exhaust./1 (0)'>Crescendo</span>
<span class='sts stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='Unplayable. When you draw this card, add 2 (3) Miracles to your hand and Exhaust.'>Deus Ex Machina</span>
<span class='sts stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='Choose a card in your draw pile. Play the chosen card twice and exhaust it. Exhaust./4 (3)'>Omniscience</span>
<span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Retain. Gain 5 (7) Block. When Retained, increase its Block by 2 (3) this combat./1'>Perseverance</span>

<span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='At the start of your next turn, enter Wrath and draw 2 (3) cards./1'>Simmering Fury</span>
<span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Retain. Enter Calm. Exhaust./1 (0)'>Tranquility</span>
<span class='sts stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='Take an extra turn after this one. End your turn. Exhaust./3 (2)'>Vault</span></p>
<p>Blasphemy requires an upgrade,
but I'm assuming you can manage that with the Blessing of the Forge.
Simmering Fury doesn't exhaust or retain,
but I'm putting it in here because it adds 2 to your draw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infinites</strong>:
These cards win the game,
so long as the deck can be exhausted down enough.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='(Retain.) Gain 5 Mantra./2'>Worship</span>:
[Cut Through Fate, Worship, Inner Peace, Empty Mind+] is energy positive and does infinite damage,
as we saw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 8 (11) Block. The next Attack you play costs 0./2'>Swivel</span>:
[Cut Through Fate, Swivel, Inner Peace, Empty Mind+] is energy neutral and does infinite damage.
(This one is pretty funny. I've never thought of this card as an infinite enabler before!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Calm, draw 3 (4) cards, otherwise enter Calm./1'>Inner Peace</span> or <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw 2 (3) cards. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Mind</span>:

<p>Great!
Let's run the numbers.
Barring garbage turn 1s like Strike Strike Defend Eruption Empty Fist,
it's reasonably safe to assume that by the end of turn 2,
we can achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw <span class='sts stsrs stsck stsgs' data-desc='Unplayable. Ethereal. Cannot be removed from your deck.'>Ascender's Bane</span> on turn 1 so it exhausts.</li>
<li>Play <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle 3 (5) random Skills into your draw pile. They cost 0 this combat. Exhaust./2'>Chrysalis</span>.</li>
<li>Exhaust <span class='sts stsu stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw cards until your hand is full. Exhaust./1 (0)'>Scrawl+</span> <span class='sts stsu stsrr stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw cards until your hand is full. Exhaust./1 (0)'>Scrawl+</span> <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Put 3 (4) random Attacks from your draw pile into your hand. Exhaust./0'>Violence</span> (they're all free), likely in service of the below.</li>
<li>Draw <span class='sts stsru stscc stsgs' data-desc='Exhaust up to 3 (5) cards in your hand. Exhaust./0'>Purity</span> together with at least 5 garbage cards (i.e. not used in the infinite), and exhaust them.</li>
<li>Draw and retain an <span class='sts stsrs stscc stsgs' data-desc='Retain. Draw 2 (3) cards. Exhaust./0'>Insight</span> if using one of those infinites.</li>
<li>Block for at least 22 (there will be 22+8×4+6+6 = 66 incoming damage, and I came in with 45hp). Killing a bird counts for 6. Alternatively, don't block and go infinite on turn 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all of that,
the deck will have 7 cards left:
9 non-exhausting cards originally,
plus 3 from <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle 3 (5) random Skills into your draw pile. They cost 0 this combat. Exhaust./2'>Chrysalis</span>,
minus 5 from <span class='sts stsu stsru stscc stsgs' data-desc='Exhaust up to 3 (5) cards in your hand. Exhaust./0'>Purity+</span>.
Is that enough to get the infinite up consistently?
If you can manage to end turn 2 in calm,
the answer is yes:
you draw at least one of <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span>, <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Calm, draw 3 (4) cards, otherwise enter Calm./1'>Inner Peace</span>, or <span class='sts stsu stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw 2 (3) cards. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Mind+</span> on turn 3.
If not...
the answer is still probably yes,
because even if you bottom deck both <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span> and <span class='sts stsu stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw 2 (3) cards. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Mind+</span>,
there are ways to save yourself
(e.g. either potion, if you didn't use them both during setup).</p>
<p>... unless your infinite is <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 6 (10) Block. Shuffle an Insight into your draw pile./1'>Evaluate</span> or <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 6 (9) Block. If the last card played this combat was a Skill, draw 2 cards./1'>Sanctity</span>,
which only block,
because then it needs to work for probably hundreds of turns
as you slowly chip away at Awakened One's HP (which is regenerating).
Ouch.
For <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 6 (9) Block. If the last card played this combat was a Skill, draw 2 cards./1'>Sanctity</span>,
once you get your infinite once,
you can choose to end the cycle when you're in calm,
so 7 cards is fine.
Awakened One is sometimes giving you <span class='sts stsrc stscc stsgs' data-desc='Unplayable. Ethereal. Whenever this card is drawn, lose 1 Energy.'>Void</span>s,
but you will still draw at least one of <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 6 (9) Block. If the last card played this combat was a Skill, draw 2 cards./1'>Sanctity</span> <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span> <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Calm, draw 3 (4) cards, otherwise enter Calm./1'>Inner Peace</span> <span class='sts stsu stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw 2 (3) cards. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Mind+</span>,
and the infinite only has a startup cost of 2.</p>
<p>It's worse for <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 6 (10) Block. Shuffle an Insight into your draw pile./1'>Evaluate</span>.
You definitely need the <span class='sts stsrs stscc stsgs' data-desc='Retain. Draw 2 (3) cards. Exhaust./0'>Insight</span> to be retained at the end of each turn
(otherwise you have 9 cards including <span class='sts stsrs stscc stsgs' data-desc='Retain. Draw 2 (3) cards. Exhaust./0'>Insight</span> and <span class='sts stsrc stscc stsgs' data-desc='Unplayable. Ethereal. Whenever this card is drawn, lose 1 Energy.'>Void</span>,
and only 4 of them say draw,
so in one of the hundreds of turns you will almost definitely miss all 3).
But that means you can't end your turns in calm,
so you still lose, because even with only 8 cards,
now <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Calm, draw 3 (4) cards, otherwise enter Calm./1'>Inner Peace</span> stops saying draw.
So you need at least one of your <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle 3 (5) random Skills into your draw pile. They cost 0 this combat. Exhaust./2'>Chrysalis</span> cards
to come from the <strong>Exhaust/Retain</strong> category above.
That lets you end all your turns in calm,
and then you have 8 cards and can't miss all of <span class='sts stsrs stscc stsgs' data-desc='Retain. Draw 2 (3) cards. Exhaust./0'>Insight</span> <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span> <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Calm, draw 3 (4) cards, otherwise enter Calm./1'>Inner Peace</span> <span class='sts stsu stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw 2 (3) cards. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Mind+</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ok! So after all of that... what you need out of <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle 3 (5) random Skills into your draw pile. They cost 0 this combat. Exhaust./2'>Chrysalis</span> is <em>either</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>any of <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='(Retain.) Gain 5 Mantra./2'>Worship</span> <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 8 (11) Block.

If the last card played this combat was a Skill, draw 2 cards./1'>Sanctity</span></li>
<li>OR <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 6 (10) Block. Shuffle an Insight into your draw pile./1'>Evaluate</span> plus any of the following:
<ul>
<li><span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Apply 8 (11) Mark. ALL enemies lose HP equal to their Mark./1'>Pressure Points</span> (makes the infinite damage positive)</li>
<li><span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 2 (3) Mantra. Gain 4 Block./0'>Prostrate</span> (makes the infinite energy positive)</li>
<li><span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Your next Attack deals 5 (8) additional damage./1'>Wreath of Flame</span> (then you only need to run the infinite twice)</li>
<li>another <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 6 (10) Block. Shuffle an Insight into your draw pile./1'>Evaluate</span> (then you can retain multiple <span class='sts stsrs stscc stsgs' data-desc='Retain. Draw 2 (3) cards. Exhaust./0'>Insight</span>s)</li>
<li>any of the 11 cards in the <strong>Exhaust/Retain</strong> category</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take care of the first case first:
there are 32 legal Watcher skills,
and 6 of them are hits,
so the probability that you get any of them is 1 - (1 - 6/32)³ = 46.36%.
Okay, that's not bad.</p>
<p>Now for the Evaluate case.
Let's count the ways to draw a good Evaluate infinite
by splitting on how many you get.
There's 1 way to draw three Evaluates.
There's 3*25 ways to draw two Evaluates plus a non-infinite non-Evaluate card.
And there's 3*(14*25 + 25*14 - 14*14) ways to draw exactly one Evaluate
and two non-infinite non-Evaluate cards,
at least one of which is in the set of 14.
So the chance you don't get any of the easy infinites but you do get an Evaluate infinite
is 1588/32768 = 4.85%.</p>
<p>Adding those together,
it comes out to a 51.21% chance of <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle 3 (5) random Skills into your draw pile. They cost 0 this combat. Exhaust./2'>Chrysalis</span> giving you what you need.
So just over half!
Given that I think almost any other decision at the shop
would have given me a &lt;10% chance of survival
(this relies on all 4 purchases of <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle 3 (5) random Skills into your draw pile. They cost 0 this combat. Exhaust./2'>Chrysalis</span>, <span class='sts stsru stscc stsgs' data-desc='Exhaust up to 3 (5) cards in your hand. Exhaust./0'>Purity</span>, <span class='sts stspotion' data-desc='Upgrade all cards in your hand for the rest of combat.'>Blessing of the Forge</span>, card remove),
I feel vindicated in my decisions.</p>
<p>... er, hang on a second.</p>
<p>I just counted the Watcher skills again,
and there's actually 34 of them, not 33.
Did I forget one?</p>
<img style='width:350px;max-width:70%' src='/img/sts/ForeignInfluence.png'>
<p>... oh no.</p>
<h2>oh no</h2>
<p>I saved this one for last
because it adds,
uh,
a bit more complexity,
shall we say.
(The probability that it matters is many times lower
than the effect of various other assumptions I made,
so I could just ignore it,
but that would be <em>lame</em>.)</p>
<p>The upgrade says &quot;it costs 0 this turn&quot;,
but unfortunately that actually means &quot;it costs 0 until leaving your hand&quot;,
so it's basically useless.
Also,
you're allowed to skip the card,
so at worst <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Choose 1 of 3 Attacks of any color to add into your hand. (It costs 0 this turn.) Exhaust./0'>Foreign Influence</span> goes under &quot;Exhaust/Retain&quot;
(and therefore enables <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsgs' data-desc='Gain 6 (10) Block. Shuffle an Insight into your draw pile./1'>Evaluate</span> all the same).
So we only need to consider cards that actually go infinite themselves.</p>
<p>Let's start with all the whiffs.
Fundamentally,
the problem with the deck as is is that the infinite cycle
<span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span> <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Calm, draw 3 (4) cards, otherwise enter Calm./1'>Inner Peace</span> <span class='sts stsu stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Draw 2 (3) cards. Exit your Stance./1'>Empty Mind+</span> is net -1 energy.
So you need something that either generates energy
or draws for cheaper.
None of these cards can help with that:</p>

<p>Of the remaining ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All of <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 7 (9) damage. Scry 2 (3). Draw 1 card./1'>Cut Through Fate</span> <span class='sts stsrc stscg stsga' data-desc='Deal 9 (12) damage.

(If the upgrade made the card free for rest of combat, they would all work except for Scrape.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class='sts stsru stscc stsga' data-desc='Deal 3 (6) damage. Draw 1 card./0'>Flash of Steel</span> just wins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class='sts stsru stscr stsga' data-desc='Deal 5 (8) damage.

If the enemy has Weak, gain [G] and draw 1 card./1'>Heel Hook</span> do the trick as long as you can apply vulnerable or weak respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honorable mention to <span class='sts stsrr stscb stsga' data-desc='Deal 24 (30) damage. Channel 3 Plasma./5'>Meteor Strike</span>, which is playable with upgraded Foreign Influence and would make the infinite energy positive if we had an orb slot. (BaseMod gives you an orb slot when you attempt to channel an orb as non-Defect, but I want the analysis to be for vanilla.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's just 3 out of 107 cards that might work,
and two of them have pretty strong caveats
given that the deck has no source of vulnerable/weak.
How can we get those?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vulnerable can come from <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='If you are in Wrath, apply 3 (5) Vulnerable to ALL enemies, otherwise enter Wrath./1'>Indignation</span>,
or another <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Choose 1 of 3 Attacks of any color to add into your hand. (It costs 0 this turn.) Exhaust./0'>Foreign Influence</span> into any of <span class='sts stsrb stscr stsga' data-desc='Deal 8 (10) damage. Apply 2 (3) Vulnerable./2'>Bash</span>, <span class='sts stsrc stscr stsga' data-desc='Deal 4 (7) damage and apply 1 Vulnerable to ALL enemies./1'>Thunderclap</span>, <span class='sts stsru stscr stsga' data-desc='Deal 13 damage. Apply 1 (2) Weak. Apply 1 (2) Vulnerable./2'>Uppercut</span>, <span class='sts stsrc stscb stsga' data-desc='Deal 3 (4) damage. Apply 1 (2) Vulnerable./0'>Beam Cell</span>, or <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 8 (10) damage. If the last card played this combat was a Skill, apply 1 (2) Vulnerable./1'>Crush Joints</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weak can come from <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Whenever you gain Block this turn, apply 1 (2) Weak to ALL enemies./1'>Wave of the Hand</span>,
or another <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Choose 1 of 3 Attacks of any color to add into your hand. (It costs 0 this turn.) Exhaust./0'>Foreign Influence</span> into any of <span class='sts stsrc stscr stsga' data-desc='Deal 12 (14) damage. Apply 2 (3) Weak./2'>Clothesline</span>, <span class='sts stsru stscr stsga' data-desc='Deal 13 damage. Apply 1 (2) Weak.

Apply 1 (2) Weak./1'>Sucker Punch</span>, <span class='sts stsrc stscb stsga' data-desc='Deal 3 (4) damage. If the enemy intends to attack, apply 1 (2) Weak./0'>Go for the Eyes</span>, or <span class='sts stsrc stscp stsga' data-desc='Deal 8 (10) damage. If the last card played this combat was an Attack, apply 1 (2) Weak./1'>Sash Whip</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unsurprisingly,
these probabilities are extremely obnoxious to compute.
I've hidden the details for your sake,
but you can still see them if you really want to.</p>

<p>Alright,
so let's count how many ways there are to draw something good
by casework again,
at the same scale for sanity
(so that e.g. the number of ways to draw a <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Choose 1 of 3 Attacks of any color to add into your hand. (It costs 0 this turn.) Exhaust./0'>Foreign Influence</span> as your first <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle 3 (5) random Skills into your draw pile. They cost 0 this combat. Exhaust./2'>Chrysalis</span> card
which gives <span class='sts stsru stscr stsga' data-desc='Deal 5 (8) damage. If the enemy has Vulnerable, gain [R] and draw 1 card./1'>Dropkick</span> as the first choice is 1/107).
There are 33 legal Watcher skills to come out of <span class='sts stsrr stscc stsgs' data-desc='Shuffle 3 (5) random Skills into your draw pile. They cost 0 this combat. Exhaust./2'>Chrysalis</span>;
we're assuming we didn't get any of the 7 infinite enablers,
so we're actually working with a pool of 26.</p>
<p>For futher sanity,
we can define <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = 1-((107-<em>n</em>)/107)((106-<em>n</em>)/106)((105-<em>n</em>)/105)
to be the probability that you find any of <em>n</em> cards in a <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Choose 1 of 3 Attacks of any color to add into your hand. (It costs 0 this turn.) Exhaust./0'>Foreign Influence</span> roll.
Also,
<em>f</em>(<em>n</em>,<em>m</em>) = (1-<em>f</em>(<em>m</em>))(1-((107-<em>n</em>-<em>m</em>)/(107-<em>m</em>))((106-<em>n</em>-<em>m</em>)/(106-<em>m</em>))((105-<em>n</em>-<em>m</em>)/(105-<em>m</em>)))
is the probability you failed to find any of <em>m</em> cards
but did find any of <em>n</em> cards.</p>
<p>With multiple <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Choose 1 of 3 Attacks of any color to add into your hand. (It costs 0 this turn.) Exhaust./0'>Foreign Influence</span>s,
you need to specify a strategy --
fortunately,
there's a clearly best one,
which is to pick the card resulting in the largest increase
in number of possible cards
to complete an infinite.</p>

<p>When all is said and done,
it turns out the probability that you don't get an immediate infinite,
but <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Choose 1 of 3 Attacks of any color to add into your hand. (It costs 0 this turn.) Exhaust./0'>Foreign Influence</span> saves you,
is... 0.184%.</p>
<p>Redoing the numbers from before,
we get a 1 - (1 - 6/33)³ = 45.23% chance of a 1-card infinite,
and a 1744/35937 = 4.85% chance of an Evaluate infinite.
Adding everything up,
the chance of any infinite is 50.266%,
which is lower than if <span class='sts stsru stscp stsgs' data-desc='Choose 1 of 3 Attacks of any color to add into your hand. (It costs 0 this turn.) Exhaust./0'>Foreign Influence</span> didn't exist (obviously)
but still just above half!</p>
