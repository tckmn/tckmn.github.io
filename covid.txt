MEETING #1

you may have heard harvard is taking classes online -- we are following suit

moving classes online, reducing # of people in living communities and workspaces

no imminent health risk, only trying to enhance community's safety

continuing vast majority of campus operations uninterrupted

want to support fsilgs in the same way we're supporting residence halls

beginning saturday, classes will go online if possible 

students will be asked to move out, email later today

hoping people can try to leave campus by tuesday of next week

no classes next week, will resume online the following week

will be considering exemptions by petition, because risks are lower when there are fewer people

criteria to consider whether to approve exemptions (won't necessarily be public announcement):
* visa issues
* international students, travel restrictions
* grad students living in private may be allowed to stay
* students who do not have a home or going home may be unsafe (family, country)

process of move out may cause financial hardship, should complete form

will work with travel office to assist financially

people who remain on campus may be relocated / dispersed to different buildings

provisions for self-isolation

will begin move out process almost immediately

don't panic, no risk to individuals, excessive precaution we're taking to mitigate risk

thinking about options for storage, moving vans, etc, more information in next day or so

dining operations continue with slight modifications until further notice (didn't catch this, something about packaged food)

=====

pack as if you're leaving for the end of the academic year

grad students who work in labs -- still being worked out

fsilgs do their storage ordinary, dorm storage somewhere else on campus

we'll work with alumini to make sure we coordinate security issues (???)

right now we are evaluating on a case by case basis regarding financial need for transportation

[chaos] we'll reconvene later if needed








MEETING #2

no guidance for students independently staying in apartments

(someone else: not in a position to regulate private off campus apartments)

we considered cancelling classes/exams this week, can pass along that request (public letter will say classes through friday)

there will be accountability; if we learn of students who are non-exempt and do not leave, they may be referred to committee on discipline

"not a matter of principle -- about public health"

nobody relocated into fsilgs, relocation only within residence halls

summer housing? ("put that one on this list for us to address")

there will be an opportunity for students with financial hardship to indicate that, reviewed on case by case basis (re shipping books/stuff home)

6 working groups split up doing different things, will pass request about add/drop date changes to "academic continuity team"

mental health? (may expand hours, request for canceling classes and exams this week will be brought up to some other group)

alumni will be a big part of that (re storage) within each house

summer housing brought up again => "pack as if you're leaving for the summer"

don't share information you're not 100% certain on

international students and visas -- will be addressed, if not in president's letter than in the followup about movein/moveout

visa concerns "certainly considered" in exemptions

security -- work collaboratively with alumns, mitpd, check in on the house on a regular basis (et-specific? unclear how general)

athletics -- should be communicated very soon

[13:02] email going out "some time soon"

joint council tonight at 7:30 W24-100 (ifc and something else)

"i'm guessing" individual faculty members will work out finals/etc with their students

grad students living in ilgs should request exemption if they have nowhere else to go, case by case basis

relocation within fsilgs: i don't know, we'll find that out

[13:07] we don't know the exact time this information will become public, hopefully very soon, hopefully this afternoon

if student body asks for information, use your best judgement, want consistent and clear information, ideally wait for reif's email as soon as possible
