<p>
For a bit of backstory,
I square dance with <a href='https://www.mit.edu/~tech-squares/'>Tech Squares</a>
every Tuesday night
(I promise this is relevant).
There are a lot of calls in square dancing
(over 1,000 at the highest level),
and one of them happens to be called Sock It To Me.
This is a reference to the once-extremely-popular TV show <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_%26_Martin%27s_Laugh-In'><em>Laugh-In</em></a>.
It also happens that there is a Bundt cake recipe
called Sock It To Me cake,
presumably also a reference to the show.
</p>

<p>
Of course,
being born 30 years after <em>Laugh-In</em> aired,
I have absolutely no association with the phrase "Sock It To Me"
other than square dancing.
So when I learned of this recipe
with the same hyper-specific name
as a call in the extremely niche group activity I do with my friends
where people often bring baked goods to share --
the next step was obvious.
</p>

<p>
At first,
I just wanted to make a Sock It To Me cake,
but I didn't have a Bundt pan.
So I bought one for this purpose,
but then it seemed silly to use it for literally one thing only,
and also I felt very powerful with my newfound fun-cake-shape abilities.
And <em>then</em> I couldn't decide what other flavor to make
because there were too many I wanted to try,
and...
this got somewhat out of hand,
and I have made a different Bundt cake
every week (that Tech Squares has met) since then.
</p>

<p>
So here are pictures of all 79 cakes so far,
which you can click on to enlarge.
There's also a lot more pictures that aren't shown,
some of them showing the baking process,
which you can click the button next to the pictures to see.

            <div class='bcomm'>  Since this was the first one, I hadn't realized the importance of fully cooling before putting on glaze yet, so you can see it was almost completely absorbed. (I have not fully learned my lesson as you will continue to see, as sometimes I make the cake Tuesday afternoon and don't give myself enough time to let it cool :P) I think I used some combination of the linked recipe and <a href='https://www.food.com/recipe/sock-it-to-me-cake-2608'>this one</a>.

            <div class='bcomm'> Possibly overcorrecting, I made the caramel "glaze" way too thick, so it ended up being more like (still tasty!) caramel frosting.

            <div class='bcomm'>  Just a few days before this one, the thought occurred to me "ooh, I wonder when the next time April 1st is on a Tuesday is? I could do something funny for that". I did not realize it was the next one! So I made this "Bundt cake," which I impassively claimed to everyone at the dance bewildered by the hole-less, non-circular shape that it was a totally normal Bundt cake, just like I had been bringing the past many weeks. And that I also had accumulated a bunch of holes from punching out the middles of previous Bundt cakes, so I figured I ought to bring those as well. The flavor was also part of the joke, as I told people this was a perfectly vanilla Bundt cake.

            <div class='bcomm'> If you've never seen a key lime, you might not realize how tiny they are; here's a Bundt cake for scale. I got an entire bag of 18 key limes without even considering that it might not be enough, and ended up having to augment with some more (regular) bottled lime juice.

            <div class='bcomm'>  This was the one year anniversary of the Bundt cake era! Still having never repeated a flavor, I pointed out that the power of combinatorics offers an enormous pool of flavors to choose from by combining three random fruits. That feels a bit like cheating, but this particular combination of three fruits is special for reasons involving my master's thesis which I will not attempt to elaborate on here.</p><p>Since I am guessing I am the first person to make a cake with this specific combination of flavors, it seems only fair that I get to name it -- the mirror image of the square dance call Sock It To Me happens to be called Here Comes The Judge (also a <em>Laugh-In</em> reference), so it seemed appropriately fitting given the history of my whole Bundt cake escapade.</p><p>The last image is a birthday cake for my Bundt cakes! A friend made it without telling me, which I thought was very sweet, but it was also extremely confusing to walk into the room and see a Bundt cake that wasn't mine. It was a lemon cake disguised as a strawberry cake.

I'm not sure what purpose it serves. Maybe as both the vegan and the terrible-sounding-cake baker, I should try this</p></blockquote> Apparently you're not supposed to be able to taste the broccoli. I sure could taste the broccoli, as could several others who thought it was terrible (I thought it was still pretty good).
