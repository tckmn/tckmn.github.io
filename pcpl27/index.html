                    This is a trivia game that tests how obscure you can get.
                    The goal is to get the fewest points.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please refrain from consulting any outside sources from this point onward.
                    Only use your own knowledge base to answer questions.
                </li>

            <h3>Game-specific rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You may provide <strong>up to 20 answers</strong>
                    for each question,
                    separated by newlines.
                    (I do not expect you to provide this many to any of the questions;
                    the limit is mostly to preserve my sanity.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    All answers after your <strong>second incorrect answer</strong>
                    will be discarded.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The score of each remaining correct answer
                    is the number of other players who gave that answer.
                    A wrong answer is scored
                    as the number of players who gave the most common correct answer plus 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A penalty of

                    will then be applied.
                    For example,
                    if your fourth answer was given by two other players,
                    it is worth 3.5 points.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your score for a question
                    is the <strong>minimum of your answer scores</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may not pass;
                    instead,
                    your <strong>highest score will be dropped</strong>.

                <p>
                    The word "robot" was coined by Karel Čapek
                    in the 1921 scifi play "Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti"
                    ("Rossum's Universal Robots").
                    It comes from the Czech word "robota",
                    meaning roughly "drudgery"/"servitude".
                </p><p>
                    <strong>
                        Name any specific robot from a piece of media categorized as "science fiction".
                    </strong>
                    The robot must have a proper name
                    (e.g. "medical nanobot from X" is invalid),
                    must be intelligent or anthropomorphic in some way
                    (not just a machine),
                    and must be completely nonliving
                    (cyborgs and the like don't count).

                    Vladimír Chvátil is a well-known board game designer
                    who was born in Czechoslovakia.
                    His most famous creation is probably Codenames,
                    which won the <i>Spiel des Jahres</i>
                    (German for "Game of the Year")
                    award in 2016.
                    In Codenames,
                    two teams of players compete
                    to communicate and guess a set of words the fastest.

                    The teams must compete with one another,
                    such that one team is declared the winner (or they tie)
                    at the end of the game.
                    There must be at least two teams,
                    and at least one team must have multiple members.

                    Throughout Bohemian history,
                    there were three notable instances
                    in which people were thrown out of windows for political reasons,
                    now known as the Defenestrations of Prague.
                    The third had the greatest impact on history,
                    inciting the Thirty Years' War,
                    in which an estimated 3 million to 11.5 million people died.

                    e.g. "pillar" is invalid because many non-castle buildings have pillars,
                    but a feature found in, say, mostly castles and palaces would be fine.
