            <p>
            You notice a list of clues tucked away under the desk, and you think to yourself: this is perfect! You happen to have a built a machine that automatically solves clues exactly like these, which is conveniently still in your pocket.
            </p>

            You excitedly plug in the machine, press some buttons, and read off the results, but to your dismay, you quickly find that something's... wrong with all of the answers (except one (which is maybe so that the results fit neatly in a grid)). You built this machine a long time ago; it seems like you'll have to think back to your <em>roots</em> to figure this one out...
            </p>

            <p>
            For some reason, you get the sense that once you've discovered what's going on, you'll have to think diagonally to figure out:
            <strong>what's the problem with the machine?</strong>
