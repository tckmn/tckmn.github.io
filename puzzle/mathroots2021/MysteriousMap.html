            <p>It's a map! And some instructions for how to get out! Seems a bit careless of Merlin to just leave this lying around... wait, this is all just nonsense?!</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Start at the center of the triangle formed by the <strong>???</strong>, the <strong>???</strong>, and the <strong>???</strong>.</li>
                <li>Head to the nearest landmark containing the color red.</li>
                <li>Turn right, and continue until reaching a landmark.</li>
                <li>Face towards where you started in step 1, and continue walking until you reach a landmark.</li>
                <li>Turn left, and continue until reaching a landmark.</li>
                <li>You just crossed an edge of the triangle described in step 1; there is a landmark between your current position and one of that edge's endpoints. Go to this landmark.</li>
                <li>Walk away from the <i>other</i> endpoint of the edge described in step 6 until reaching another landmark.</li>
                <li>Turn right, and continue until reaching a landmark.</li>
                <li>Walk to the nearest animal, but don't stop there; instead, skip over it and continue until hitting another landmark in the same direction.</li>
                <li>Continue walking in the same direction still, until reaching a third landmark on this line.</li>
                <li>Walk directly south until you reach a landmark.</li>
            </ol>
